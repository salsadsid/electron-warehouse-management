                            JWT - JSON Web Token - is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server.JWT is used for transmit information between to parties.A JWT String made of three parts. 1. the header, 2. the payload, 3. the signature.It works in complex way. The server generates a token that certifies the user identity, and sends it to the client. The client will send the token back to the server for every subsequent request, so the server knows the request comes from a particular identity.
